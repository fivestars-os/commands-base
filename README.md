# commands-base
Stores base commands container configuration for aladdin projects to inherit from

## Examples

1. Using the command-base container image [here](./examples/base_docker_image)<br/>
   Useful for quickly getting up and running or trying out aladdin commands for the first time
2. Using a custom container image [here](./examples/custom_docker_image)<br/>
   Useful for when your project is already using a custom docker image and only needs the commands-base executable
3. Using a custom container image and Poetry [here](./examples/poetry_example)<br/>
   Same as above, but with Poetry (https://python-poetry.org/)
